# cli-calculator-python
#The primary objective was to create a functional CLI tool using Python that supports basic arithmetic operations. The application was built to demonstrate proficiency in fundamental Python concepts, including defining custom functions, managing program flow using loops, and implementing conditional logic for user interaction.
A loop-based structure, allowing the user to perform continuous calculations until they choose to exit8.Basic operations: Addition ($+$), Subtraction ($-$), Multiplication ($*$), and Division ($/$).Enhanced operations (added for robustness): Exponentiation, Square Root, and Modulo.Robust user input handling, including validation using try-except blocks to prevent crashes from non-numeric input and specific error handling for undefined operations (e.g., division by zero)6666.The use of dedicated functions for each mathematical operation, promoting a well-structured and modular code design
